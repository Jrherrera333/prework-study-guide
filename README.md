# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- As time goes by my desire to learn how to code grows stronger, so it was very interesting for me to engage in this project because I'm passionate about code. 
- Building this project was an important stepstone for me, as I was able to see the process of how to go about building a website. and also it helped me to be better prepared to perform better at the full stack web developer certificate.
- What problem does it solve? It gives me an understanding of how HTML, CSS and Javascript files work, and are put together. I also learned how to complete the git workflow for each file and the importance of a README file. The web page was made for practice purposes, and to have a place on the web that anyone can access, learn, and remember from the knowledge gained by the process of building this project.
- I was able to learn how to use Git version control, create a code repository, complete the Git workflow, and save my work.
